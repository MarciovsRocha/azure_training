## Virtual Machines

### What is a Virtual Machine?

Its a service that cloud providers offer that fall under the 
category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It is a portion
of a machine that is running in an Azure data center that you 
can control. You don't actually have control of the physiscal 
machine, but it looks and acts like a server that you can control. 
It supports Windows or Linux operating systems. You can remote 
into it, install any software you wish, and you only need to pay 
for it for the time that you use it. 

### What is a benefit of using ARM (Azure Resource Management) Templates

You can create resources by using JSON templates and by passing 
parameters. In this way, you can automate resource creation and 
implement Desired State Configuration. This lets you control how 
your environment looks and prevents developers of OPS from changing 
it accidentally.
